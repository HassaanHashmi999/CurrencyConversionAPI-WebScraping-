## Api Usage and Json prase Exercise 

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a software program that provides communication channels
following the HTTP protocol between 2 applications. It is usually used for allowing a client to request or update
information from a server.
You are tasked to develop a Python program that will perform currency conversion using data fetched from an open-
source API: https://www.frankfurter.app/
The goal of your program is to display the current conversion rate between 2 currency codes at a specific date. It
will also calculate the inverse conversion rate between these 2 currencies.
To do so, you will need to call 2 different API endpoints from the Frankfurter app:

Extracting the list of available currency codes (documentation:
https://www.frankfurter.app/docs/#currencies)
Extracting the historical conversion rate for the specified currency codes and a given (documentation:
https://www.frankfurterapp/docs/#historical)
